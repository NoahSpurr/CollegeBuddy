            <p>
                Here will be the Reminders <br />
                * Firstly, there will be reminders every 1 days, 3 days, 1 week, 3 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, etc. (changeable, but this is the default)<br />
                * add individual items<br />
                * add flashcards<br />
                * add problems<br />
                * interface with canvas for grades/assignments/everything?<br />
                * interface with google calendar, so would show the tasks, maybe you can add a tag that will designate something as an "assignment" that will have a due date or you can have classes or office hours<br />
                * AI for suggested improvements <br />
                    * "Recommended schedule" for highest grades/keeping stuff on track/etc. <br />
                * Resume Booster section for internships -- so like if you are a cs student, then ideas for webapps etc.<br />
